## Why AGPL3?
I wanted a license that will keep my code open source. I believe in open source software and in-case this project goes unmaintained by me, I want it to live on through the work of others. And I want that work to remain open source to prevent a time when a fork can never be continued (i.e., closed-sourced and abandoned).
